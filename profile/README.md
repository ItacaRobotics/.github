# Welcome to itaca robotics!
Itaca Robotics is an organization dedicated to the integration of robotics projects, merging theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice. Our mission is to constantly push the boundaries of our knowledge and gain experience through new projects. We firmly believe in the Discover, Learn and Improve philosophy. For us, a meaningful project is one that, at the moment you conceive it, you don't yet know how to accomplish it, but you know you want to achieve it!
